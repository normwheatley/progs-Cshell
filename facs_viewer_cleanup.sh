# This script is facs_viewer_cleanup.sh.
# Purpose: This script lets you remove many Customer Site databases from the Ordo facs_viewer using a file that lists 
#          the sites to be removed.
# 
# Author: Norm Wheatley (C) Vigilent August 2015
#
DESCRIPTION="
This script removes Customer databases from the Ordo facs_viewer. Several questions are asked :-
1) Do you just want a list of the current customer sites? (you can create the removals list from this) 
2) Username ... you cannot remove customer sites anonymously.
3) Reason ... why are the sites being removed
4) Removals file ... this is a list of the sites to be removed, the format is
<CUST>-<SITE>-<VERSION> ... and you can use comments eg

# 
# This is a sample Removals.list file
#
IBM-NC-3
IBM-NC-4
VERIZON-RESTON-11
VERIZON-RESTON-13

NOTE: A log file will be created in the format fviewer-removals-<DATE>-<User>.log
      Any incorrect listings in the Removals file will be skipped.
