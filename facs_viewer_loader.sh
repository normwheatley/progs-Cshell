# DATE: 7/30/2015 - initial script written.
#
# This script takes Customer site backups (Db or logs) and stores them on the # # Ordo server. The database backups are also installed on the facs_viewer.
# Emails are sent out when finished.
# The script is run every 30 minutes (or so) as a cron job. The script uses the # box-linux-sync and WebDAV (davfs2) programs to mount Vigilent's complete # # # # Box.com file set on the drive /nfs 
#
#DESCRIPTION="
This script adds Customer Site databases to the Ordo facs_viewer. It should be run as an hourly cron job. It scans the Vigilent Box.com account for
log and database backup (.tgz) files. The backup files are saved and the originals re-named. Emails are sent out when finished.
Output log files are in ~/facs_viewer4/cron-output-facs_viewer_loader.log and ~/db_FacsViewerArchive/facs_viewer4_posting_logs with format <DATE>-<CUST>-<SITE>.log

The script uses the box-linux-sync and WebDAV (davfs2) programs to mount Vigilent's complete Box.com file set (All Files > Customer> Ordo-upload-files) on
the drive /nfs/box-files-all-vigilent/Ordo-upload-files.

# LOGICAL PSEUDOCODE (can be put in a README file at some stage):
#
# first ensure we're running under sudo ... if not, exit with log msg L4 "must 
# invoke with sudo"
# set working directory - this is needed when it runs in a cron job
# now ensure a previous program is not still running ... if busy exit with log
# msg L1 "busy - try later" 
# if box-linux-sync is up and running (Box folders exist) then
#   continue and write log message L6 - "Box-linux-sync is running ok"
# else
#   if the box-linux-sync password file doesn't exist, exit with log/email msg 
#           M9 - "Box-linux-sync is dead and we cannot find the password file."
#   else try to start box-linux-sync and send log/email msg M12 "Trying to start 
#               box-linux-sync"
#     if ok 
#       sleep for 60 seconds to let files mount
#       continue with log/mail msg M10 - "Box-linux-sync started ok"
#     else
#       exit with log/email msg M11 - "Box-linux-sync didn't start with login 
#                                        file"
# now get the new files *.tgz
# repeat for each *.tgz file found
# extract the customer and site name .... log msg L2 - "got new .tgz file"
# if file is empty ... exit with log/email msg M8 - "file is empty"
# if the file is invalid .. rename file, skip to next, with email/log M6 "file 
#                    is not a valid logs or DB backup - skipping and renaming"
# If the filename contains spaces or brackets then change them to dashes (ie 
#                                  rename the file) .. this is for Reggie :)
# check file integrity  (using tar -tf)
#   if file is corrupt ... rename file and exit with log/email msg M7 - "backup 
#                                                           is corrupt, renamed"
#   if ok then
#     write log msg L3 - "file is good"

#       copy to log repo
#       if ok

#
# Assumptions:
#   1. all log file backups will contain the word "log" (in any case)
#   2. All database backups will not contain the word "log" but will contain the 
#                                                                    word "back"
#   3. <CUST>, <SITE> and .tgz folder/file names should not contain spaces or
#                                                             brackets.
#   3. Spaces and braces in .tgz filenames will be changed to dashes "-" 
#   4. Spaces and brackets in <CUST> and <SITE> folders are not changed - their 
#                                            .tgz files will not be processed.
#   5. We create all <CUST>/<SITE> directories before storing the backup .tgz                        
#                                                                    files 
#   6. After copying the files we change owner from root to fc (they're root as 
#                                                             we run in sudo).
#   6. We check whether the program is already running (using ps -ef) 
#   7. send email as CC to Roy and shawna - waiting for 
#                 facs_viewer_admin@vigilent.com email alias to be created.
#
# TO DO
#  1. check that both <SITE> and <CUST> folders are present  
#  2. Create the README file and put it somewhere useful
#
# write out the help info
